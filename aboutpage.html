            <h1 >Discover how practical work improves student learning across science subjects </h1>
            <p>
                This chemistry practiacl site is aimed at secondary school science students who are looking to improve learning and engagement among students aged 14-16 through practical science.
            </p> 

            <p>
                The six featured courses explore strategies and approaches for incorporating practical work into science lessons. By looking at context, progression, assessment, and learning outcomes, those involved in teaching science will develop approaches to improve engagement and encourage learning. The six courses build up teaching practice by using examples from chemistry.
            </p> 
  
        <h1>Improve science learning outcomes using active learning</h1>
            <p>
                The question of how to engage students in science subjects goes wider than just schools. It is a matter of record that we are facing a global STEM skills gap. Developing practical and scientific skills with students throughout school will be key to addressing this skills gap in the near future
            </p>
        <h1>Explore approaches to making learning come to life using practical science experiments</h1>
            <p>
                Hands-on science allows students to better understand the connection between theory and practice. Using practical science experiments can make what students have learned in textbooks come to life. By involving students in the learning process, teachers can encourage active learning, and ultimately boost learning outcomes.

    <h2 >Experience required</h2><div class=""><p>This chem-lab is aimed at those involved in teaching science in secondary schools, to students aged 14-16 years. Youâ€™ll need to have awareness of the science curriculum and health and safety requirements for teaching hands-on science in your local area. The courses are built around the  GES framework, though the insights would be relevant to any science teaching context.</p>

      <p>The examples used in this course are based on practical science experiments for students aged 14-16 years. The approaches to practical science explored would also be relevant for those teaching students aged 11-19 years.</p>

  <section class="child" id="childb">
    <h2 >Getting started</h2><div class=""><p>This chem-lab will improve your confidence in undertanding practical science and enable you to develop approaches in planning practical science experiments to improve student learning.</p>
            
      <p>This chem-lab for students and others involved in learning science for students aged 14-16 is designed to facilitate a peer-to-peer learning environment, with discussion, activities and reflection.</p>
      
      <p>Learners would benefit from some experience of teaching science as well as a strong grasp of relevant scientific principles.</p>
